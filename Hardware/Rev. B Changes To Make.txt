### PCB Changes ###
1) Fix slide switch (ground opposite throw and float current throw) - DONE
2) Silk screen marking area to indicate LiPo charger enabled (charge controller PROG resistor fitted so not compatible with other battery types) - DONE
3) Voltage range silk screen marking near JST connector (3.7V - 4.5V ???) - DONE
4) Silk screen warning to only use LiPo cells of at least 500mAh capacity (due to 500mA charge current) - DONE
5) Ensure as many floating parts of the ground plane are tied to ground, remove if not possible - DONE
6) Add power status LED (green, powered from 3.3V rail, move D13 LED to under ADXL335, power LED takes it's place) - DONE

### BOM Changes ###
1) All caps to max. voltage rating for ceramic dielectric.
2) Change to a 500mA trip current fuse, with 250mA holding current (Littelfuse series) (in some cases badge will need to be disconnected from USB to reset fuse).
3) Change charge controller PROG resistor to 2k (500mA charging current).
